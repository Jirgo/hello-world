Hey there!

My name is Joe Putt, and I've only recently began an IT career within the last year or so, I have a huge plate and I'm starving for more knowledge! This is just the beginning for me, although it is an exciting time to be starting a new career, it is equally intimidating. My motiviation comes from hearing about new tech, whether it be hardware or software and getting myself to the point of understanding that I may be able to explain it in depth with others around me with the same passions.
